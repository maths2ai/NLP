# Introduction  

This Jupyter Notebook, which is highly inspired by the Deep Learning Udacity Course I have completed, 
contains an LSTM architecture that reads a text by Tolstoj and tries to "invent" something similar.

## Requirements

You need to install numpy and torch.
Also, create a folder data, in the same directory where you clone the notebook, containing the text you want to emulate.
