# Introduction  

This Jupyter Notebook, which is highly inspired by the Deep Learning Udacity Course I have completed, 
contains an LSTM architecture that reads a text by Tolstoj and tries to "invent" something similar.

We prepare the Tolstoj text so that if the input is a sequence like "Ciao", the LSTM will have a first character 
input "C" and as a first character output "i".

## Requirements

You need to install numpy and torch.
Also create a folder data, in the same directory where you clone the notebook, which contains the text you want to emulate.
